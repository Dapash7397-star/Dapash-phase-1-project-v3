# Aviation Risk Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes aviation accident data to provide insights into aircraft safety and risk levels.  
The analysis was conducted using Python, Pandas, and Tableau to clean, analyze, and visualize aviation accident data.  
The ultimate goal is to identify patterns that can help business stakeholders make informed decisions about entering the aviation industry.

## Business Understanding
The primary objective of this analysis is to determine the **lowest-risk aircraft** for a company planning to enter the aviation industry.  

### Stakeholders
- **Business executives**: Need to understand risk levels before investing in aircraft.  
- **Safety officers/regulators**: Want evidence-based insights on aircraft risks.  
- **Investors**: Require data-driven justifications for strategic decisions.  

### Key Business Questions
1. Which types of aircraft are most associated with fatal accidents?  
2. How have aviation accidents trended over time?  
3. Which regions or countries report the highest number of accidents?

## Data Understanding and Analysis

### Source of Data
- **Dataset**: National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) aviation accident data (1962â€“2023).  
- **Link**: [NTSB Accident Data](https://www.ntsb.gov/)  

### Description of Data
- **Columns**: Year, Country, Aircraft Damage, Fatalities, Injuries, Aircraft Type, etc.  
- **Size**: Civil aviation accidents and selected incidents across the United States and international waters.  
- **Cleaning & Preparation**: Missing values handled by imputation/removal, categorical variables standardized.

## Conclusion

### Summary of Findings
1. **Accident trends have decreased over time**, especially in the past two decades, reflecting improved aviation safety standards.  
2. **Certain aircraft types are more prone to fatal accidents**, highlighting the importance of careful fleet selection.  
3. **Accidents are concentrated in specific regions**, suggesting that geographic factors influence aviation risk.

## Recommendations
**Based on the findings, three clear business recommendations emerge:**
1. **Invest in Low-Risk Aircraft Models**
-Acquire aircraft with consistently lower accident severity rates, as these models provide safer and more reliable operations while strengthening customer and investor trust.
2. **Avoid High-Risk Models and Hazardous Regions**
-Exclude aircraft types with a history of frequent or fatal incidents and carefully evaluate high-accident regions. Entering safer markets first will reduce exposure to avoidable risks.
3. **Adopt Strong Safety Practices**
-Complement fleet selection with robust operational practices such as predictive maintenance systems, rigorous pilot training, and continuous monitoring of flight data. This ensures long-term safety and compliance with international standards.

### Next Steps
- Recommend fleet investment in aircraft types with historically lower fatality rates.  
- Continue monitoring global accident data for updated trends.  
- Combine accident data with maintenance and operational cost data for a full risk-benefit analysis.
