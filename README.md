## 1: Background
### The company is expanding its portfolio by entering the aviation industry, focusing on both commercial and private air travel. However, aviation carries inherent safety and financial risks, especially when it comes to aircraft accidents, reliability, and maintenance. To ensure a successful and sustainable entry into this industry, the company requires an evidence-based assessment of aircraft safety and associated risks.
## 2: Project Overview

### This project leverages historical accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), covering civil aviation accidents and selected incidents from 1962 to 2023. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to identify aircraft types with the lowest safety risks. The insights generated will guide business stakeholders in making informed decisions on which aircraft are most suitable for purchase and operation, minimizing risk exposure and maximizing operational reliability.
## 3: Business Understanding
### Goal: Determine which aircraft types are associated with the lowest risk for accidents/incidents.
### Objectives:
1. To assess the distribution and severity of aircraft accidents across different aircraft models and manufacturers.
2. To analyze the relationship between accident characteristics (fatalities, damage level, risk category) and the likelihood of aircraft being involved in fatal incidents.
3. To identify trends in aviation accident frequency and severity over time and across geographical locations.
## 4: Data Understanding
The analysis used data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), covering civil aviation accidents and selected incidents from 1962 to 2023, including events in the United States and international waters.
Key features included:
Aircraft details: model, manufacturer, and type.
Accident characteristics: fatalities, injuries, damage level, and risk categories.
Contextual factors: year, location, and country.
Data preprocessing involved:
Handling missing values to ensure accuracy.
Aggregating accident records for meaningful comparisons.
Structuring variables for effective visualization in the interactive dashboard.
